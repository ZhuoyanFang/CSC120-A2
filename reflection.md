Use this file to record your reflection on this assignment. 

What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

In the new files, we can store information about a specific computer, store the inventory for the store, updates a computer's price,updates a computer's OS, buys a computer, sells a computer and refurbish a computer. Also, we can create another resale shop and do the same things. At first, I mixied up the parameters of computer and item_id, especially when I was trying to print the inventory. Then I realized that we did not need to use the item_id as the parameter to buy, sell or refurbish a computer but just we the computer, and then everything went more smoothly.

My advice is that, being clear of deciding how you want to represent the inventory before writing the methods, and try the small methods like buy() and sell() before running the full main() program.
